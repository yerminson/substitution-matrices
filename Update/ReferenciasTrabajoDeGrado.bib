	abstract = "Motivation: Methods that focus on secondary structures, such as Position Specific Scoring Matrices and Hidden Markov Models, have proved useful for assigning proteins to families. However, for assigning proteins to an attribute class within a family these methods may introduce more free parameters than are needed. There are fewer members and there is less variability among sequences within a family. We describe a method for organizing proteins in a family that exhibits up to an order of magnitude reduction in the number of parameters. The basis is the log odds ratio commonly used to measure similarity. We adapt this to characterize the sequence dissimilarities that give rise to attribute differentiation. This leads to the definition of Class Attribute Substitution Matrices (CLASSUM), a dual of the BLOSUM.Results: The method was applied to classify sequences hierarchically in the lambda and kappa subgroups of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Positions conferring class were identified based on the degree of amino acid variability at a position. The CLASSUM computed for these positions classified better than 90\% of test data correctly compared with 35--50\% for BLOSUM-62. The expected value for a random matrix is 14\%. The results suggest that family-specific data-derived substitution matrices can improve the resolution of automated methods that use generic substitution matrices for searching for and classifying proteins.",

Standard log-odds matrices, such as those of the PAM and BLOSUM series, are constructed from large sets of protein alignments having implicit background amino acid frequencies. However, these matrices frequently are used to compare proteins with markedly different amino acid compositions, such as transmembrane proteins or proteins from organisms with strongly biased nucleotide compositions. It has been argued elsewhere that standard matrices are not ideal for such comparisons and, furthermore, a rationale has been presented for transforming a standard matrix for use in a non-standard compositional context.Results: This paper presents the mathematical details underlying the compositional adjustment of amino acid or DNA substitution matrices.Availability: Programs implementing the methods described are available from the authors upon request.Contact: altschul@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov",

@article{PROT:PROT21087,
	abstract = "Analysis of protein structures based on backbone structural patterns known as structural alphabets have been shown to be very useful. Among them, a set of 16 pentapeptide structural motifs known as protein blocks (PBs) has been identified and upon which backbone model of most protein structures can be built. PBs allows simplification of 3D space onto 1D space in the form of sequence of PBs. Here, for the first time, substitution probabilities of PBs in a large number of aligned homologous protein structures have been studied and are expressed as a simplified 16 × 16 substitution matrix. The matrix was validated by benchmarking how well it can align sequences of PBs rather like amino acid alignment to identify structurally equivalent regions in closely or distantly related proteins using dynamic programming approach. The alignment results obtained are very comparable to well established structure comparison methods like DALI and STAMP. Other interesting applications of the matrix have been investigated. We first show that, in variable regions between two superimposed homologous proteins, one can distinguish between local conformational differences and rigid-body displacement of a conserved motif by comparing the PBs and their substitution scores. Second, we demonstrate, with the example of aspartic proteinases, that PBs can be efficiently used to detect the lobe/domain flexibility in the multidomain proteins. Lastly, using protein kinase as an example, we identify regions of conformational variations and rigid body movements in the enzyme as it is changed to the active state from an inactive state.

@article{RIS_0,
	abstract = "BACKGROUND: Several different methods for contact prediction succeeded within the Sixth Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP6). The most relevant were non-local contact predictions for targets from the most difficult categories: fold recognition-analogy and new fold. Such contacts could provide valuable structural information in case a template structure cannot be found in the PDB. RESULTS: We described comprehensive tests of the effectiveness of contact data in various aspects of de novo modeling with CABS, an algorithm which was used successfully in CASP6 by the Kolinski-Bujnicki group. We used the predicted contacts in a simple scoring function for the post-simulation ranking of protein models and as a soft bias in the folding simulations and in the fold-refinement procedure. The latter approach turned out to be the most successful. The CABS force field used in the Replica Exchange Monte Carlo simulations cooperated with the true contacts and discriminated the false ones, which resulted in an improvement of the majority of Kolinski-Bujnicki's protein models. In the modeling we tested different sets of predicted contact data submitted to the CASP6 server. According to our results, the best performing were the contacts with the accuracy balanced with the coverage, obtained either from the best two predictors only or by a consensus from as many predictors as possible. CONCLUSION: Our tests have shown that theoretically predicted contacts can be very beneficial for protein structure prediction. Depending on the protein modeling method, a contact data set applied should be prepared with differently balanced coverage and accuracy of predicted contacts. Namely, high coverage of contact data is important for the model ranking and high accuracy for the folding simulations.",

@article{M{\"u}ller01062001,
	abstract = "Given a transmembrane protein, we wish to find related ones by a database search. Due to the strongly hydrophobic amino acid composition of transmembrane domains, suboptimal results are obtained when general-purpose scoring matrices such as BLOSUM are used. Recently, a transmembrane-specific score matrix called PHAT was shown to perform much better than BLOSUM. In this article, we derive a transmembrane score matrix family, called SLIM, which has several distinguishing features. In contrast to currently used matrices, SLIM is non-symmetric. The asymmetry arises because different background compositions are assumed for the transmembrane query and the unknown database sequences. We describe the mathematical model behind SLIM in detail and show that SLIM outperforms PHAT both on simulated data and in a realistic setting. Since non-symmetric score matrices are a new concept in database search methods, we discuss some important theoretical and practical issues.Contact: muelle\_t@molgen.mpg.de",

	abstract = "Motivation: We propose a general method for deriving amino acid substitution matrices from low resolution force fields. Unlike current popular methods, the approach does not rely on evolutionary arguments or alignment of sequences or structures. Instead, residues are computationally mutated and their contribution to the total energy/score is collected. The average of these values over each position within a set of proteins results in a substitution matrix.Results: Example substitution matrices have been calculated from force fields based on different philosophies and their performance compared with conventional substitution matrices. Although this can produce useful substitution matrices, the methodology highlights the virtues, deficiencies and biases of the source force fields. It also allows a rather direct comparison of sequence alignment methods with the score functions underlying protein sequence to structure threading.Availability: Example substitution matrices are available from http://www.rsc.anu.edu.au/~zsuzsa/suppl/matrices.html.Supplementary information: The list of proteins used for data collection and the optimized parameters for the alignment are given as supplementary material at http://www.rsc.anu.edu.au/~zsuzsa/suppl/matrices.html.Contact: zsuzsa@rsc.anu.edu.au",
